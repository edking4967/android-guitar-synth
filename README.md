### What is this repository for? ###
Android-guitar-synth: a simple synth that can be controlled via Bluetooth input. Created for a school project, it can be used to connect a normal electric guitar which can be used to trigger synthesizer notes.

### How do I get set up? ###

Currently, this project only includes the Android side of the code, the synth engine and some buttons to play notes. The other side, the code necessary to read the guitar notes, is designed for a frumpy development board, the LPCXpressso. You can run it as an Android project and play notes from the app, but no guitar input yet.
